### Usage Instructions for the Script

Here is how you can use the provided script to fetch JSON data from an API, process the data to extract YAML files, and generate a CSV report.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed, along with the necessary libraries:
- `requests`
- `pyyaml`

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install requests pyyaml
```

#### 2. Script Overview
The script performs three main tasks:
1. **Fetch JSON data from an API**: Sends a POST request to an API endpoint with a JSON payload and saves the response as a file.
2. **Extract YAML files**: Reads the saved JSON file, extracts `dbConfigYaml` and `workflowYaml` into separate raw and formatted files.
3. **Generate CSV report**: Parses the JSON data and generates a CSV report with specific fields.

#### 3. How to Run the Script
You need to run the script with the API URL, payload, and output file parameters. Here's how:

##### a. Define Your Input Payload
Update the `input_payload` inside the script with the two key-value pairs that are required for your API request:
```python
input_payload = {
    "key1": "value1",
    "key2": "value2"
}
```

##### b. Define the API URL
Ensure that you have the correct API URL (`api_url`) in the script:
```python
api_url = "https://dfhg.org.config/asfryg"
```

##### c. Save the Script as a Python File
Save the script with a `.py` extension (e.g., `process_json.py`).

##### d. Run the Script
From the terminal or command line, navigate to the directory where the script is saved and run the following command:

```bash
python process_json.py
```

### Output Files

1. **JSON Result File**: After the API call, the response will be saved as `api_result.json` in the current directory.
2. **YAML Files**: The script will extract two YAML files from the JSON result and save them under a folder named after the `repository` field from the JSON data:
   - `db_config.yml`: The formatted content from `dbConfigYaml`.
   - `db_config_raw.yml`: The unformatted raw content.
   - `db_migration.yml`: The formatted content from `workflowYaml`.
   - `db_migration_raw.yml`: The unformatted raw content.
   
   These files will be saved under a directory named after the `repository` (e.g., `db-inventory-common/`).

3. **CSV Report**: A CSV report will be generated as `report.csv` with the following fields:
   - `repository`: Name of the repository.
   - `branch`: The branch name.
   - `folderName`: The folder name.
   - `teamName`: The team name.
   - `members`: List of members as a pipe-separated string.

### Example Output Files

#### Example CSV (`report.csv`)
```csv
repository,branch,folderName,teamName,members
db-inventory-common,main,dbscripts,gha-db-ci-cd-db-inventory-common-600000170,hgaur|sshahzeb
```

#### Example YAML Directory and Files
If the repository is `db-inventory-common`, you will find the following structure:
```
db-inventory-common/
├── db_config.yml
├── db_config_raw.yml
├── db_migration.yml
└── db_migration_raw.yml
```

### Customizing or Extending the Script
- **API Endpoint**: Change `api_url` to point to your actual API endpoint.
- **Input Payload**: Update the `input_payload` in the script to match the required structure for the API.
- **File Paths**: The script uses relative paths for file saving. If you want to save the files to a specific location, update the paths accordingly.

### Example Command to Run:
```bash
python process_json.py
```

This will trigger the entire workflow—fetching the JSON result, extracting the YAML files, and generating a CSV report.
