No, the cache mechanism is not strictly necessary, especially if you're scanning only recently modified files (`-mtime -1`) or if you're comfortable scanning all files without skipping previously validated ones. The cache was just an optimization to avoid redundant checks for files already validated as non-corrupted.

If you'd prefer to avoid the cache and keep the script simple, you can remove the caching logic. Here's a streamlined version without the cache:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Directory to search for XML files
BASE_DIR="/apps/active-cache/"

# Log file to store corrupted files
LOG_FILE="/tmp/corrupted_xml_files.log"

# Number of parallel processes
NUM_PROCESSES=4

# Function to check XML validity
check_xml_file() {
  local file="$1"
  
  # Validate the XML file
  if ! xmllint --noout "$file" 2>/dev/null; then
    # If corrupted, log and remove
    echo "Corrupted XML found and deleted: $file" >> "$LOG_FILE"
    rm "$file"
  fi
}

# Export the function to be used by parallel processes
export -f check_xml_file
export LOG_FILE

# Only check modified files (-mtime -1) in parallel, logging only corrupted ones
find "$BASE_DIR" -type f -name "*.xml" -mtime -1 | xargs -n 1 -P "$NUM_PROCESSES" -I {} bash -c 'check_xml_file "{}"'

echo "Process completed. Corrupted XML files are logged in $LOG_FILE."
```

### Summary:
- **Cache removed**: The script now checks all `.xml` files modified in the last day (`-mtime -1`) without skipping any based on a cache.
- **Parallel execution**: It uses `xargs` to run in parallel across multiple CPU cores for faster processing.
- **Only logs corrupted files**: Logs and removes corrupted files, with no unnecessary output for valid files.

This version is simpler and may suit your needs better if you're running it frequently and don't want to maintain a cache of validated files. Let me know if you'd like to adjust anything else!
