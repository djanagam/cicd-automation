| xyseries user hour count
| eval title="User Activity Heatmap"

6. Repository Creation Over Time

7. Top IPs Accessing Repositories

Shows the IP addresses accessing repositories the most.

index=github_audit sourcetype=github_audit_events action=repository.access
| stats count by ip_address
| rename count as "Access Count"
